Agile excels here.</p><p> In recent years, I've enjoyed the rise in focus on quality in the frontend toolbox, and multi-device development, which I consider the strength of HTML and associated tech.</p><p>I enjoy the continuous learning this industry demands, and sharing improved tools and methods with my colleagues.</p>"
